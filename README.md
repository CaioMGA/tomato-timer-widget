# Why I made this?

I was diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation in October 2023. According to the doctors, the herniation is huge. Although
the chief physician strongly suggested that I undergo surgery immediately, I refused it, at least for now.

I'm currently undergoing conservative treatment and hoping for improvement. I understand that this is a long-term battle
and that there are many measures I need to take. According to my physical therapist, I should stand up and stretch every
30 minutes after sitting. It occurred to me later that
the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) follows a similar schedule: 25 minutes of
work followed by a 5-minute break. This approach aligns perfectly with my treatment plan.

I use Trilium Notes throughout the day, so creating a Pomodoro timer for Trilium seemed like a natural idea. I've been
using this timer actively during my treatment. I believe it's important to take breaks and rest your body after
prolonged periods of sitting.

Hopefully, this can help prevent others from developing lumbar disc herniation.
